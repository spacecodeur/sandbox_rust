# üß† Smart Pointers in Rust

## Introduction
Smart pointers manage memory safely and efficiently. In Rust, they are essential for handling ownership, borrowing, and memory safety. This guide ranks them by **difficulty**, **importance**, **threading context**, and provides explanations for their acronyms when applicable.

> The following table is sorted according to a **suggested progression for learning**, starting with the most fundamental and commonly used smart pointers.
> It is also **grouped by threading context**: first the single-threaded use cases, then the multi-threaded ones.

## üß© Summary of Common Pointer Patterns

| Pattern              | Use Case Example |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `Rc<RefCell<T>>`     | Mutability + shared ownership in single-threaded UI/state trees |
| `Arc<Mutex<T>>`      | Shared mutable state across threads (classic pattern) |
| `Arc<RwLock<T>>`     | Concurrent reads + occasional writes across threads |
| `Rc<T>` + `Weak<T>`  | Tree structures with parent-child relationships (single-thread) |
| `Arc<T>` + `Weak<T>` | Same as above, but in multi-threaded context |
